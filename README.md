# FDTD_Field_Weaver
## Introduction
This application is an experiment in the use of the Finite Difference Time Domain to solve a 1-dimensional electromagnetic system.

## Features
The script currently has no boundary conditions, so the number of time steps is limited to prevent reflection back into the solution space.
